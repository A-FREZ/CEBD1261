Week 4 Exercices:
Instructions 
Please send a .sc file via github. If you use Scala IDE, just save your .sc file and submit.  If you didn’t reach that level (yet), copy text from your command line into a text file and  submit that via github. 
Note:  
● My assumption was you are familiar with python to write the following codes.  You need some googling to do and have two weeks to submit your work.   ● Next session, I will go over them. 
 
Exercise 1 (Mandatory) 
Define the following values: 
● val x : Double = 42.354562  ● val y : Int = 3 
Write required code in println command to print the following output: 
● The round value of x is 42.35  ● The left zero padding version of y is 0003 
Obviously 42.35 and 0003 should be computed. 
 
Exercise 2 (Mandatory) 
Write a function to compute factorial (5! = 5*4*3*2*1) 
Then write another function to call fact function and println few examples (i.e, 6,8,4.52).  Your program should return NA if the input is not integer.  
 
Exercise 3 (Mandatory) 
Repeat the previous exercise by accepting the double numbers into the factorial  function. Convert them to integer before calling the fact function.
